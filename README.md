# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company specializing in individualized financial plans. They approached Global Rain, a software engineering company, with a request to conduct a vulnerability assessment of their web-based software application. The main concern for Artemis Financial is ensuring secure communications and maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of their client's sensitive financial information. The client wanted Global Rain to identify potential security vulnerabilities in their application and address any issues that could compromise the security of client data and the overall system.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I utilized static testing techniques to identify vulnerabilities in the application's dependencies and third-party libraries. By analyzing the version numbers and associated vulnerabilities, I could recommend updates or patches to address the known security issues. So, I think I did very well in conducting static testing. Coding securely is important to protect sensitive data, comply with regulations, prevent cyber-attacks, maintain customer trust, and cost saving. Software security adds significant value to a company's overall well-being by safeguarding its operations, reputation, and customer relationships.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
During the vulnerability assessment, one challenging aspect was identifying potential security vulnerabilities through manual code review. This required a deep understanding of secure coding practices and knowledge of common security pitfalls. It involved meticulously examining the codebase, looking for vulnerabilities such as input validation issues, SQL injection, and access control vulnerabilities. This process demanded attention to detail and a thorough understanding of potential attack vectors. It provided an opportunity to strengthen my understanding of secure coding practices, vulnerability analysis, and risk mitigation.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
In order to increase the layers of security for Artemis Financial's web application, I recommended implementing input validation, adopting cryptography, strengthening client/server architecture via HTTPS, enhancing code quality and error handling, and keeping dependencies up to date. In the future, to assess vulnerabilities and determine appropriate mitigation techniques, I would utilize a comprehensive approach combining manual code reviews, automated vulnerability scanning tools, and penetration testing. 

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Security testing, including vulnerability scanning, was conducted to assess the robustness of the refactored code against potential security threats. A thorough code review was conducted to evaluate the refactored code for adherence to secure coding practices and to identify any potential security flaws. Regular security assessments and vulnerability scans were done to identify and address any new vulnerabilities introduced.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Tools like OWASP can assist in identifying potential security flaws and provide recommendations for mitigation. Following coding guidelines such as OWASP Secure Coding Practices, CERT Secure Coding Standards, or industry-specific secure coding guidelines helps developers write more secure code. Following methodologies like Microsoft's Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) can help embed security practices at each stage of development. Keeping software dependencies, libraries, frameworks, and third-party components up to date is critical for addressing known vulnerabilities.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would showcase the mitigation plan proposed to address the identified vulnerabilities. This plan mirrors my expertise in recommending appropriate security measures, such as implementing input validation, and access modifiers, as well as the importance of regular updates and monitoring for security patches.
